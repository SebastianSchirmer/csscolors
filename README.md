## Build locally

To build the dist files locally, first install npm packages by running either `yarn install` or `npm install`, depending if you prefer yarn or npm.
 
Then run `gulp build` or `gulp build --minify` for a non-minified or minified build respectively.
 
The default `gulp` task creates a non-minified build with browser-sync and watch enabled.
